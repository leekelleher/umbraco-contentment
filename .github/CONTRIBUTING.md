**Branching information.** Given there are now multiple versions of Contentment that support multiple versions of Umbraco, please make note of the branching structure.

- The main [`develop`](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/tree/develop) branch is where the latest work happens. This defaults to the most recent version of Contentment, (at the time of writing, this is v3.x).
- The [`dev/v1.x](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/tree/dev/v1.x) branch is for Contentment **v1.4.x** patch releases, this targets Umbraco **v8.6.1**.
- The [`dev/v2.x](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/tree/dev/v2.x) branch is for Contentment **v2.2.x** patch releases, this targets Umbraco **v8.14.0**.
- The [`dev/v3.x](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/tree/dev/v3.x) branch is for Contentment **v3.x** (current) releases, this targets both Umbraco **v8.17.0** and **v9.0.0**.

Further reading, I've been thinking a lot about Jeff Geerling's post ["Why I close PRs (OSS project maintainer notes)"](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/why-i-close-prs-oss-project-maintainer-notes) lately. If you do submit a PR and feel that I'm closing it down, this is probably the rationale behind it.
