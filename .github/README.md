## Umbraco Contentment

> contentment /kənˈtɛntm(ə)nt/ - a shoebox of happiness and satisfaction

### What is it?

This is a collection of Umbraco components that I have developed for use on my own **Umbraco 8** implementation projects.

Some components may be innovative, others may be a reimagining of existing components, property-editors, features and other community packages.


#### Why should I use it?

I'm sharing my code with the world. It is your choice (and responsibility) whether you would like to use it.
No pressure or marketing spin from me.


#### What's on offer?

Let's open the shoebox and take a look inside...

##### Property Editors

- [Bytes](../docs/editors/bytes.md)
- [Data List](../docs/editors/data-list.md)
- [Icon Picker](../docs/editors/icon-picker.md)
- [Notes](../docs/editors/notes.md)
- [Render Macro](../docs/editors/render-macro.md)


#### Release status

My aim to have a private v1.0 beta release ready soon, with a public release by end of Q1 (March) 2020.

Downloads will be made available, (in due course), on the [releases page](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/releases).


#### Known issues

_There are currently no known issues with the Contentment package._


### Documentation

[Documentation for each of the components - with screenshots, use-cases and code examples - can be found in the /docs folder](../docs/).

Please note, you may find other components within Contentment that have not yet been documented.
_Let's call those "undocumented features"._


### Support

I've been doing open source for a long time. I have suffered my fair share of burnout and empathy fatigue.

I reserve the right to address bug reports or feature requests in my own time, or ignore them completely.

**Any feedback is warmly welcome.** But please keep in mind, I am not your personal support developer.

The Umbraco community is amongst the friendliest on our planet, learn to embrace it.<br>
Ask for help on the [Our Umbraco support forum](https://our.umbraco.com/), I am sure someone can help you there.
