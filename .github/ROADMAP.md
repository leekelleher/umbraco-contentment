# Umbraco Contentment - Roadmap

Here is a _provisional_ roadmap for the Umbraco Contentment package, to be actioned at my own pleasure.


## v1


### v1.0

Initial release. Property Editors are:

- [Bytes](../docs/editors/bytes.md)
- [Data List](../docs/editors/data-list.md)
- [Icon Picker](../docs/editors/icon-picker.md)
- [Notes](../docs/editors/notes.md)
- [Render Macro](../docs/editors/render-macro.md)

### v1.1

- Content Blocks _(a StackedContent-esque editor)_

### v1.2

- Checkbox _(includes "Inline Checkbox" option)_
- Data List UIs _(possibly Cards, Text Input, Toggles)_

### v1.3

- Cascading Dropdown List _(uses API endpoints to populate the dropdowns)_
- Code Editor _(using ACE bundled with Umbraco)_

### v1.x-future

**Internally used editors** that could potentially be made into standalone property editors.

- Configuration Editor
- Data Table

**Other editor ideas...** _(already prototyped)_

- Dimensions ([#1](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/pull/1))
- Macro Blocks _(a MacroContainer-esque editor)_


**Validation exploration**

None of the editors have explicit validation implemented, (only because I've never researched it).<br>
Could be an interesting to explore the validation approaches for the Contentment editors.


## v2

- _Who knows?!_ `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
- Let's see if new ideas can be sparked from Umbraco v8.4+!
