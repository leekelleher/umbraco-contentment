## Contentment for Umbraco

### Documentation

> If there are any parts of the documentation that are unclear, [please do let me know](https://github.com/leekelleher/umbraco-contentment/issues/new/choose).

> Sometimes I can be too close to the code to understand how others (e.g. you) will use it. :v::heart::dove:
